Description:
This notebook investigated various aspects of a dataset regarding statistics about shows performed on Broadway from June 9, 1985 to March 1, 2020. The investigation found that Broadway tends to make a larger gross during its stronger months of December, November, March, April, May, and June. It also found the top ten most performed shows and found that those shows account of more than 20% of all performances. It also joined the CPI table with the grosses table to calculate the grosses when adjusted for inflation and found that the average gross has increased over time, even when adjusted for inflation. The average ticket prices for each show were grouped together by month, and their average was joined with the CPI table to show how the average ticket prices have increased over time, even when adjusted for inflation. The minimum average percent capacity for the periods of five years was calculated and stylized to note the periods with the lowest and highest average capacities, with the lowest periods being 1985-1989 and 2000-2004 and the highest period being the one beginning in 2020, though this data is from only half of the one year, so it likely cannot create a certain conclusion.

Assignment Instructions:

Some general guidelines for your data investigation:

    Choose and describe data that includes at least two separate tables (in two separate files) with both quantitative and categorical data.
    Visualize some quantitative variable(s) of the data in a way that summarizes the data effectively and write a short observational description.
    Visualize some categorical variable(s) of the data in a way that summarizes the data effectively and write a short observational description.
    Summarize some aspect of the data in a table that involves grouping or pivoting and write a short observation description.
    Summarize some aspect of the data in a table that involves joining the two tables and write a short observational description.
    Describe the dataset(s) in an introductory section.
    Write a section at the end with concluding remarks.
