The main.ipynb notebook includes an additional visualization of the minimum average weekly percent 
capacity, resampled into periods of five years.

The addition groups the average percent capacity of each week and finds the minimum value for every 
five years. This data is visualized in a pivoted table with the percent capacity as the index and the 
periods of five years as the columns. 

Any of the minimum average capacities under 50% were stylized to print in
red text. This notes whenever the average capacity of a week's shows in a period of five years was 
less than half, which shows that there was a significant drop in attendance for Broadway shows during
some week in that period. Similarly, the minimum average capacities over 80% were stylized to print
in green, showing the time period that had the highest average minimum percent capacity.
