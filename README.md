Advanced Scientific Programming, Prof. Earl, Spring 2022

This repository contains assignments made for Advanced Scientific Programming, an elective I took in the Spring 2022 semester. This course focused on data 
storage and analysis using various tools and libraries. All projects were coded in Python. Projects 4, 5, and the final project were created in Jupyter
Notebooks.
