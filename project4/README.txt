Make a Jupyter notebook named main.ipynb that reads in the file toycars.csv into a Pandas DataFrame. More information about the file can be found here:

https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/DAAG/toycars.html

Create a new DataFrame that satisfies the following criteria:

 1.   Distance measurements must be in millimeters.
 2.   The angle values are the index.
 3.   The DataFrame row are sorted in ascending order based on the index.
 4.   There is a column for each car
 5.   There is a column that is the mean of the distance measurements.
 6.   There is a column that is the standard deviation of the distance measurements.

The standard header information must be in a markdown cell. The code must be in a code cell. You must only use basic Pandas array operations to implement your solution. 
The use of the following functions will result in a grade of zero for the assignment: groupby, pivot, pivot_table.
